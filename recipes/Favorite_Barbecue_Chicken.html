    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade BBQ sauce recipe for chicken is not-too-sweet, not-too-tangy, and finishes in almost a glaze. Everyone loves it! It would also be great on pork chops or ribs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté until tender, about 2 minutes. Stir in ketchup, honey, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper; simmer until sauce has thickened slightly, about 1 or 2 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside to cool slightly. </li>
        <li> Dip chicken in sauce to coat on both sides; reserve remaining sauce in the skillet. Transfer chicken onto the preheated grill and cook, turning once, until nicely browned on all sides, about 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
        <li> Return chicken to the skillet with sauce; simmer over medium heat until sticky, about 5 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
    </ol>
